          <h1>About </h1>
          <p>Simply put, I love design. I have a passion for creating detailed websites that feel young, fresh, and inviting to users.

            <p>My journey started in Raipur, Chhattisgarh and these past years have been incredible. Through my education and practical experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in frontend development, utilizing modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I thrive on transforming design concepts into functional and responsive websites that not only look stunning but also deliver a smooth browsing experience across different devices.</p>

            <p>In addition to my frontend development and UI/UX skills, I also possess a flair for web design. I enjoy bringing ideas to life by designing visually striking layouts that align with the brand's vision and identity.

              I am constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest industry trends and best practices in frontend development and design. I am excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals and contribute to innovative projects that push boundaries and deliver exceptional digital experiences.</p>
            
            <p>A bit about myself; I am studying computer science at the anjuman collage of Engineering. I find arts and drawing fascinating, and enjoy playing badminton. Always down to collaborate if I have the time. Reach out to me if you need any work done!</p>

                  <h3>UI/UX</h3>
                  <p>A quality design conveys a quality brand. Because your website will be the first impression a visitor will have of you, the design of your site is crucial to letting clients and potential partners feel positive and optimistic when learning about you.</p>

                    <p>Many websites do a poor job of achieving good design due to misrepresentation of brand identity. Understanding the meaning and emotion behind your mission is vital to letting your visitors feel the same way as you do. UI/UX communicates this in a variety of ways, and I am committed to getting to know you to help achieve this.</p>
